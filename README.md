- This application allows users to sign up and log in using local storage. 
- Before logging in, users need to sign up to create an account and store the data. 
- Once signed up, users can log in using their credentials. 
  - If a user doesn't have an account, they won't be able to log in and will see an - unsuccessful message along with a sign-up button. 
  - In case a user enters incorrect information, there is also a login button available.
- After successful login, a message indicating successful login will be displayed, along with a sign-out button. 
- Clicking the sign-out button triggers a pop-up notification confirming the successful sign-out and the user is redirected back to the login page.
